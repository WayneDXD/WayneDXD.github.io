<p>These canveses are inspired by the some of the activities that you do with your family and friends during the holidays. As you scroll thorugh the page you will see canveses like skating and bulding a snow man. I believe that the holidays can be a speacial time that can help build a tighter bond with your family and also celebrate a time to show one another that you care.  </p>
